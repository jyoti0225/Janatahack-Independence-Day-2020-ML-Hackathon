# Janatahack-Independence-Day-2020-ML-Hackathon
This hackathon was organised by Analytics Vidya to showcase their machine learning skills by sharing their approaches and more important to learn how to apply machine learning and predictive analytics to new domains. In this hackathon, we have to perform Topic Modeling for Research Articles.It is a multi-label classification problem.<br>
In this repository, I used machine learning and deep learning models along with NLP to solve this problem.

## Problem Statement - 
Researchers have access to large online archives of scientific articles. As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process.

Given the abstract and title for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set. Note that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic. The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following 6 topics: 

1. Computer Science
2. Physics
3. Mathematics
4. Statistics
5. Quantitative Biology
6. Quantitative Finance
